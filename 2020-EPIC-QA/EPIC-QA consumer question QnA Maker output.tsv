COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads, the severity of illness it causes, and to what extent it may spread in the United States.

Disability alone may not be related to higher risk for getting COVID-19 or having severe illness. Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID-19.  However, some people with disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection or severe illness because of their underlying medical conditions.  All people seem to be at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 if they have serious [underlying chronic medical conditions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html) like chronic lung disease, a serious heart condition, or a weakened immune system.

MERS-CoV, like other coronaviruses, likely spreads from an infected person’s respiratory secretions, such as through coughing. However, we don’t fully understand the precise ways that it spreads.

MERS-CoV has spread from ill people to others through close contact, such as caring for or living with an infected person. Infected people have spread MERS-CoV to others in healthcare settings, such as hospitals. Researchers studying MERS have not seen any ongoing spreading of MERS-CoV in the community.

All reported cases have been linked to countries in and near the Arabian Peninsula. Most infected people either lived in the Arabian Peninsula or recently traveled from the Arabian Peninsula before they became ill. A few people have gotten MERS after having close contact with an infected person who had recently traveled from the Arabian Peninsula. The largest known outbreak of MERS outside the Arabian Peninsula occurred in the Republic of Korea in 2015 and was associated with a traveler returning from the Arabian Peninsula.

Public health agencies continue to investigate clusters of cases in several countries to better understand how MERS-CoV spreads from person to person.

"Preventing transmission of respiratory pathogens including MERS-CoV in hospitals requires the application of infection control procedures and protocols including environmental and engineering controls, administrative controls, safer work practices, and personal protective equipment (PPE).

Though these recommendations focus on the hospital setting (a setting where MERS-CoV transmission has been reported from some international locations), the recommendations for PPE, source control (i.e., placing a facemask on potentially infected patients when outside of an airborne infection isolation room), and environmental infection control measures are applicable to any healthcare setting. **This guidance does not apply to non-healthcare settings (e.g., schools) OR to persons outside of healthcare settings.** This guidance also does not provide recommendations for clinical management, air or ground medical transport, or laboratory settings which can both be found elsewhere on the CDC [MERS website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/index.html).

This revised notice clarifies the NIOSH definition of respirator sealing surfaces, including the primary seal, and facial stubble. This revised notice supersedes the October 2, 2006 letter and the August 2018 version of NIOSH CA 2018-1005.

Specific to the evaluations completed as part of the NIOSH Respirator Approval Program, and testing to assess the fit characteristics of all respirator designs, NIOSH test subjects are required to be clean- shaven in order to participate on the test panel selected.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Respiratory Protection Standard 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.134 paragraph (g)(1)(i) states, *“The employer shall not permit respirators with tight-fitting facepieces to be worn by employees who have: (A) Facial hair that comes between the sealing surface of the facepiece and the face or that interferes with valve function; or (B) Any condition that interferes with the face-to-facepiece seal or valve function.”*

The OSHA requirement is [interpreted](https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/standardinterpretations/2012-09-14) as: When a respirator is required, an employer is prohibited from allowing respirators with tight-fitting facepieces to be worn by employees who have “facial hair that comes between the sealing surface of the facepiece and the face, or that interferes with valve function. Facial hair is allowed, as long as it does not protrude under the respirator seal, or extend far enough to interfere with the device’s valve function.”

CQ016	how long does coronavirus survive on surfaces?	"Preventing transmission of respiratory pathogens including MERS-CoV in hospitals requires the application of infection control procedures and protocols including environmental and engineering controls, administrative controls, safer work practices, and personal protective equipment (PPE).

Many patients in general hospitals, and especially in referral centers, are likely to be at high risk for complications of influenza. Hospitalized susceptible patients may acquire influenza from other patients, hospital employees, or visitors. The preferred method of control is to administer inactivated influenza vaccine to high-risk patients and medical personnel.

During community influenza A activity, the use of antiviral prophylaxis may be considered for high-risk patients who were not immunized or were immunized too recently to have protective antibody levels. Antiviral agents may also be considered for unimmunized hospital personnel. Other measures include restricting visitors with respiratory illness, cohorting patients with influenza for 5 days following onset of illness, and postponing elective admission of patients with uncomplicated illness.

Primary influenza viral pneumonia is an uncommon complication with a high fatality rate. Reye syndrome is a complication that occurs almost exclusively in children taking aspirin, primarily in association with influenza B (or varicella zoster), and presents with severe vomiting and confusion, which may progress to coma due to swelling of the brain.

Other complications include myocarditis (inflammation of the heart) and worsening of chronic bronchitis and other chronic pulmonary diseases. Death is reported in less than 1 per 1,000 cases. The majority of deaths typically occur among persons 65 years of age and older.

The most frequent complication of influenza is pneumonia, most commonly secondary bacterial pneumonia (e.g., *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, *Haemophilus influenzae*, or *Staphylococcus aureus*). Primary influenza viral pneumonia is an uncommon complication with a high fatality rate. Reye syndrome is a complication that occurs almost exclusively in children taking aspirin, primarily in association with influenza B (or varicella zoster), and presents with severe vomiting and confusion, which may progress to coma due to swelling of the brain.

Other complications include myocarditis (inflammation of the heart) and worsening of chronic bronchitis and other chronic pulmonary diseases. Death is reported in less than 1 per 1,000 cases. The majority of deaths typically occur among persons 65 years of age and older.

*   37% of hospitalizations among persons younger than 65 years of age

*   Greater number of hospitalizations during years that A(H3N2) is predominant

Among children 0–4 years of age, hospitalization rates have varied from 100 per 100,000 healthy children to as high as 500 per 100,000 for children with underlying medical conditions. Hospitalization rates for children 24 months of age and younger are comparable to rates for persons 65 and older. Children 24-59 months of age are at less risk of hospitalization from influenza than are younger children, but are at increased risk for influenza-associated clinic and emergency department visits.

Healthy children 5 through 18 years of age are not at increased risk of complications of influenza. However, children typically have the highest attack rates during community outbreaks of influenza. They also serve as a major source of transmission of influenza within communities. Influenza has a substantial impact among school-aged children and their contacts. These impacts include school absenteeism, medical care visits, and parental work loss. Studies have documented 5 to 7 influenza-related outpatient visits per 100 children annually, and these children frequently receive antibiotics.

CQ026	what are the early symptoms of COVID-19?	"The main symptoms of TS are tics. Symptoms usually begin when a child is 5 to 10 years of age. The first symptoms often are motor tics that occur in the head and neck area. Tics usually are worse during times that are stressful or exciting. They tend to improve when a person is calm or focused on an activity.

The types of tics and how often a person has tics changes a lot over time. Even though the symptoms might appear, disappear, and reappear, these conditions are considered chronic.

In most cases, tics decrease during adolescence and early adulthood, and sometimes disappear entirely. However, many people with TS experience tics into adulthood and, in some cases, tics can become worse during adulthood.[1](/ncbddd/tourette/facts.html#ref)

CQ027	what is known about people that have COVID-19 without any symptoms?	"Medical examiners, coroners, and pathologists should **immediately** notify their [local](https://www.naccho.org/membership/lhd-directory) or [state](https://www.cste.org/page/EpiOnCall) health department in the event of the identification of a deceased person with known or suspected COVID-19.

State and local health departments can contact CDC’s Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at 770-488-7100 for urgent consultation if an autopsy is being considered for a deceased person with known or suspected COVID-19 or if submission of autopsy tissue specimens or postmortem swabs to CDC for COVID-19 testing is desired. The EOC will assist local/state health departments to collect, store, and ship specimens appropriately to CDC, including during afterhours or on weekends/holidays.

This interim guidance is based on what is currently known about [coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/index.html).

Current knowledge supports that spread of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) usually happens when a person is in close contact (i.e., within about 6 feet) via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. This route of transmission is not a concern when handling human remains or performing postmortem procedures. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes. This is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads, but we are still learning more about how this virus spreads. CDC will update this interim guidance as additional information becomes available.

**This document provides specific guidance for the collection and submission of postmortem specimens from deceased known or suspected COVID-19 cases. **This document also provides recommendations for biosafety and infection control practices during specimen collection and handling, including during autopsy procedures. The guidance can be used by medical examiners, coroners, pathologists, other workers involved in providing postmortem care, and local and state health departments. Postmortem activities should be conducted with a focus on avoiding aerosol generating procedures and ensuring that if aerosol generation is likely (e.g., when using an oscillating saw) that appropriate engineering controls and personal protective equipment (PPE) are used. These precautions and the use of [Standard Precautions](https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/isolation/) are  appropriate work practices to help prevent direct contact with infectious material, percutaneous injury, and other hazards related to moving human remains and handling embalming chemicals.

Medical examiners, coroners, and other healthcare professionals should use professional judgment to determine if a decedent had signs and symptoms compatible with COVID-19 during life and whether postmortem testing is necessary. Many patients with confirmed COVID-19 have developed fever and/or symptoms of acute respiratory illness (e.g., fever, cough, difficulty breathing). There are epidemiologic factors that may also help guide decisions about COVID-19 testing, such as documented COVID-19 infections in a jurisdiction, known community transmission, contact with a known COVID-19 patient, or being a part of a cluster of respiratory illness in a closed setting (e.g., a long-term care facility). Testing for other causes of respiratory illness (e.g., influenza) is strongly encouraged."	2.0	16.13	https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-postmortem-specimens.html	C:/Dev/EPIC-QA/epic_qa_consumer_2020-06-10_v2.tar/version_2_split	bceba12379d3b7042f03570be73a37d5d988cb66.json	This interim guidance is based on what is currently known about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).Current knowledge suggests that spread from a living person happens with close contact (i.e., within about 6 feet) via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, similar to how influenza and other respiratory pathogens spread.

*Because influenza surveillance does not capture all cases of flu that occur in the U.S., CDC provides these estimated ranges to better reflect the larger burden of influenza. These estimates are calculated based on CDC’s [weekly influenza surveillance data](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/overview.htm) and are preliminary.

**Influenza testing across the United States may be higher than normal at this time of year because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

This web page provides weekly, preliminary estimates of the cumulative in-season numbers of flu illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths in the United States. CDC does not know the exact number of people who have been sick and affected by influenza because influenza is not a reportable disease in most areas of the U.S. However, CDC has estimated the burden of flu since 2010 using a mathematical model that is based on data collected through the [U.S. Influenza Surveillance System](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/overview.htm), a network that covers approximately 8.5% of the U.S. population (~27 million people).

CQ043	how has the COVID-19 pandemic impacted violence in society, including violent crimes?	"Administrators should always reinforce healthy practices among their staff and students, as well as prepare for a potential case of COVID-19, regardless of the current level of community transmission.

As you create and update your preparedness plans, work with your local health officials to determine the most appropriate plan and actions for your school or program. Together, you will need to consider your local community situation—whether you have local transmission in your community, and if so, the level of transmission (none/minimal, minimal to moderate, substantial).

CDC has created overall guidance, as well as guidance tailored for transmission level in your area to help child care programs, schools, and their partners understand how to help prevent COVID-19 and react quickly when a case is identified.  The guidance includes information about the following:

*   How to prepare if you have no community spread of COVID-19.

*   How to prepare if you have minimal to moderate community spread in your community.

*   How to prepare if you have substantial community spread in your community.

*   What to do if a person with COVID-19 has entered your school.

These actions include staying home when sick; appropriately covering coughs and sneezes; cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces; and washing hands often with soap and water. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if they are visibly dirty. 	38390f953bb4863181f9db23e8651750b7c37646-C001-S000:38390f953bb4863181f9db23e8651750b7c37646-C001-S014

CQ043	how has the COVID-19 pandemic impacted violence in society, including violent crimes?	Right, I think both in the pandemic, but also with seasonal flu; one thing is just to allow workers to stay home if they are ill.  We know that people want to work and the worst ones are probably the doctors and nurses that come in.  And so making it possible for people to be able to telework, making it possible for them to stay home and not infect others, also even allowing them to be in a place at work where maybe they are separated.  Those are things that definitely can help in terms of social distancing, that is getting them away from each other so that they are not transmitting as easily.  That’s hard, but that’s something that can be encouraged, especially teleworking, to help people to do that.  Doing vaccine campaigns at work is very helpful because then it makes it easy for people to get vaccinated and that impact from a vaccine can also help mitigate the issues with seasonal flu.  And then there are on the CDC website and also on the CDC Foundation website, tools for businesses that you can access for making sure that businesses are thinking about pandemic and how to respond to them and including influenza seasonal, there’s checklists and other things like that and tools to help folks that are in occupational health and that are over those kinds of issues at large corporations.  So thank you very much for the questions that you have given.  We would love to hear from folks regarding what you would like to see with the use of 1918; it was a significant period of time historically.  It had an impact on our survivability; it actually is something that you can see clearly the amount of impact from deaths due to the 1918 pandemic.  Remembering that 100 years later, I think is important.  It makes it clear to us that there are things that we can do to get ready.  Influenza is a severe disease and so we want to take it seriously and make sure that if something like this were to happen again, that we would be more prepared than we are.  So with that, thank you very much and I look forward to hearing from you all.	6.0	15.73	https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-commemoration/1918-webinar.htm	C:/Dev/EPIC-QA/epic_qa_consumer_2020-06-10_v2.tar/version_2_split	69a2d455bb4cf39ce4bf88a927af33a1a6338702.json	Doing vaccine campaigns at work is very helpful because then it makes it easy for people to get vaccinated and that impact from a vaccine can also help mitigate the issues with seasonal flu.
