# CSDC - The COVID-19 Symptom Data Challenge

https://www.symptomchallenge.org/

This challenge is quite broad - I've focussed on the non-US dataset of survey data produced by University of Maryland (UMD). 

My solution combines a python script to download the dataset (large CSV files or complex API calls), and a Power BI dataset and report for data transformation and analysis.

As the dataset is vast and complex, and I dont bring any particular medical or public health expertise to this challenge, I've focused on "Exploratory Data Analysis" (EDA). Power BI is an interactive tool, so an untrained user can use the report pages to explore almost any aspect of the dataset.

My hope is that by exposing a significant chunk of the survey dataset to a broader audience, others might find insights or be inspired to dig deeper.

As my code settles, I plan to add more of the historical data, and will try to keep this up-to-date as further data is released.
