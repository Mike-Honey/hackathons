# CSDC - The COVID-19 Symptom Data Challenge

https://www.symptomchallenge.org/

This challenge is quite broad - this solution is focussed on the non-US dataset of survey data produced by University of Maryland (UMD). 

This solution combines a python script to download the dataset (large CSV files or complex API calls), and a Power BI dataset and report for data transformation and analysis.

As the dataset is vast and complex, the aim of this solution is to empower those with medical or public health expertise to easily explore and analyse interactively. Power BI is an interactive tool, so an untrained user can use the report pages to explore almost any aspect of the dataset, using just a web browser, with response times in seconds. 

In data science terms, this might be called an "Exploratory Data Analysis" (EDA), but this solution offers a far broader scope than could ever be achieved with a custom-coded EDA. 

Experience across many scenarios has shown that when subject-matter experts are freed to explore a complex dataset using this approach, they can quickly find meaningful insights or be inspired to dig deeper.

As the solution code settles, more of the historical data will be added. This solution will be updated as further (more recent) data is released.
